# Simon Game

A simple Simon game implemented in JavaScript to practice and enhance my programming skills.

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where the player needs to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. The sequence gets longer and more challenging as the player successfully repeats it.
